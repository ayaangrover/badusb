# Code of Conduct
## Responsible Use of Scripts

The scripts in this project are proof of concept only.

* **Use Only on Authorized Devices**: Please only use the scripts on your own devices.
* **Legal Compliance**: Please don't use them to do anything illegal.
* **Ethical Considerations**: Before you do anything, make sure it's legal. If you do anything illegal or get into trouble, it's not my fault. 

**My Note:** Please don't do something bad with the scripts. It's just for fun, to test if it is actually possible to these. They haven't all been tested so they might not work. Feel free to make a PR if you find an issue and want to help and fix it. Thanks!
